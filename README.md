This is a simple model to get duplicate names, it has not made use of machine learning as such but instead a very interesting library fuzzywuzzy has been used.Firstly we clean up the dataset a bit to transform it into usable form.We basically have created separate columns for first,last ,middle name and suffix if any. Although in majority of the cases we do not have a middle name ,there I have replaced it with a new character 'nan'.Then we have created two new columns ,one is 'concat' which sums over all the values in a row making a new string , this new string can be used as a matching criteria,secondly we have made 'fullname' column which .I have then shown several approaches in finding for most matchable names.Firstly on the basis of fuzz ratio using the column 'concat'.The other approach is a bit more complex where we use fullname and use several function to determine the matching probability and at last we take a cumulative effect of all these functions .
